I collected 5 ham emails and 6 spam emails as the input.
Also tested 5 ham emails and 6 spam emails. From those 5 tested ham emails, only 2 out of 5 results as positive email. 
From those 6 tested spam emails, only 3 out of 6 results as negative email. 
The accuracy is kind of low in my sample due to the limitation of the resource. 
I only can gather these much emails. As the features are collected from a very small sample, 
the results might not be very accurate. 
From my observation, the word "immediately" stored as a feature in negative email function. 
So every email contains this word will be detected as a spam email. And the same way as positive email function.
